| REQ018         | State Management: Implement client-side state management to persist data in browser memory (no backend).  | As a user, I want the employee data I manage to be persisted within the browser session  so that it's available even if I refresh the page, using a client-side state solution.     | Employee data is managed by a client-side state management mechanism (e.g., Redux, or a custom solution).  Data persists in browser memory (e.g., localStorage or sessionStorage).                                           |
| REQ019         | Localization: Support Turkish and English, reading language from html[lang] attribute.               | As a user, I want to be able to use the application in either Turkish or English, with the language automatically set based on my root HTML's lang attribute.             | All user-facing text in the application supports both Turkish and English.  The application detects and applies the language specified in the lang attribute of the root HTML element.                                      |
| REQ020         | Unit Tests: Detailed unit tests for each component and functionality, with >= 85% coverage.           | As a developer/stakeholder, I want comprehensive unit tests covering at least 85% of the codebase  to ensure code quality, maintainability, and catch regressions early.    | Each web component and significant piece of JavaScript logic has detailed unit tests.  The overall test coverage ratio is 85% or higher.                                                                                  |
| REQ021         | LitElement Version: Use LitElement's JavaScript version.  Starter project can be used.       | As a developer, I will use the JavaScript version of LitElement for creating the application, and I can utilize the official LitElement JavaScript starter project as a base. | The project is developed using LitElement with JavaScript, not TypeScript.  The LitElement JavaScript starter project may be used as a foundation.                                                                             |
